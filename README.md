# Modern Front-End Development for Rails

This repo is a step-by-step walkthrough of [the book "Modern Frontend Development for Rails"](https://pragprog.com/titles/nrclient2/modern-front-end-development-for-rails-second-edition/) by Noel Rappin

I'm going through this book to get familiar with new Rails features like Hotwire, Stimulus, and also gain experience with more advanced frontend practices - React and Redux development
